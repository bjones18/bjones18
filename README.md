<!-- Insert Image of myself here or cool banner --> 

My name is Brianna Jones, and I am so glad you decided to hop onto my page to check out my work! While Iâ€™m still in the early stages of my journey and learning the ropes, I firmly believe that what I donâ€™t know now is simply a matter of "not yet.". 
With that mini introduction out of the way let me walk you through what I've been working on. :relaxed:

## My Projects 

* **Should I Read This?** - My Master's Capstone project that utilizes different machine learning models to determine if an email is a phishing scam solely on the text of the email. This was my first project that helped me obtain hands on experience with ML and R. 

* **PIXLEY** - (**passion project _in the works_**) a virtual AI assistant sits as a mod on your laptop screen, monitoring and encouraging students while they work online. Its main job is to track text and social media chats, looking for predatory or inappropriate language. If such language is detected, the program takes a screenshot, saves it in a read-only shared folder, and alerts parents. This tool aims to support early intervention for children and teens while helping parents stay involved in their kids' online activity.

* **Forensic Automation** - (**passion project _in the works_**) a digitial forensic tool that use digital recognition tools to filter pictures based on the contents of a picture. This would (ideally) help forensic analysts and investigators to comb through thousands of photos. Essentially it would allow analysts to address the more interesting photos such as "photos with a 'man', 'person', 'car', or 'strange object'" instead of analyzing every single photo.
