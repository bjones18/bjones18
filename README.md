## Hey Ya'll 👋

My name is Brianna Jones, and I am so glad you decided to hop onto my page to check out my work! While I’m still in the early stages of my journey and learning the ropes, I firmly believe that what I don’t know now is simply a matter of "not yet.". 
With that mini introduction out of the way let me walk you through what I've been working on. :relaxed:

## My Projects 

* **Should I Read This?** - (**completed**) My Master's Capstone project that utilizes different machine learning models to determine if an email is a phishing scam solely on the text of the email. This was my first project that helped me obtain hands on experience with ML and R. 

* **PIXLEY** - (**passion project _in the works_**) a virtual AI assistant sits as a mod on your laptop screen, monitoring and encouraging students while they work online. Its main job is to track text and social media chats, looking for predatory or inappropriate language. If such language is detected, the program takes a screenshot, saves it in a read-only shared folder, and alerts parents. This tool aims to support early intervention for children and teens while helping parents stay involved in their kids' online activity.

* **Forensic Automation** - (**passion project _in the works_**) a digitial forensic tool that use digital recognition tools to filter pictures based on the contents of a picture. This would (ideally) help forensic analysts and investigators to comb through thousands of photos. Essentially it would allow analysts to address the more interesting photos such as "photos with a 'man', 'person', 'car', or 'strange object'" instead of analyzing every single photo. 


## About Me
 
* 🌆 I currently live and have been a Dallas resident my whole life! I love our dynamic art and food culture even though the traffic on I-35 can be bit challenging. 

* 💻 What made me interested in cyber/technology? As an elder genz I grew up with the internet (no, I am not an Ipad kid) like watching videos on YouTube, playing games, and talking to my friends about the latest memes when we weren't playing imagination outside. Well, one of my favorite Youtubers to watch was MatPat from Game Theory and he just released his own show called Game Lab. A fun show where gamers were challenged to play their favorite games in real life, taking gaming mechanics from the virtual to the real world. One episode in particular was based off of Watch Dogs 2 and it was all about **hacking**. I was hooked! From there I wanted to know everything about hacking, cyberspace, and cybersecurity. It sparked an inner curiosity that later ignited into a passion, especially after seeing people I care about fall victim to cybercrime. Since then I have, as my mentor put it, filling the buckets. 

* 🎓 career path: I have just graduated college and am excited to get the ball going! I have a lot to learn but my motto is "if there is a will, there is always a way".  

* 😍 Interested in helping others through my church and volunteer work. I have become very passionate about human traffick prevention and aim to have my career focus to that. I also love learning and am so grateful to be apart of a community that never stops!

* 🌱 I’m currently learning: Ethical Hacking, OSINT, how to self-host, and ML/AI. 

* ❤️ It's been my grandma, my mom, and I ever since I can remeber. I love them so much and could not have been where I am without their prayers and support. We also love to travel together whether that is flying internationally or roadtripping through the great American States! 

* ⚡ My job experience has been the following. I went from a retail clerk -> dance shoe fitter -> co-owner of a soap company -> dance teacher -> office manager -> freelance use-of-force coder -> Infosec Student Assitant. Most occuring at the same time, even while in school 😂

* 💎 Fun fact: My family and I have rescued, fostered, and run a dog-watching business since I was 12.
